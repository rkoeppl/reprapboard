Requirements:
- same pinout as currently used ones
- heat-sink'able
- more available than currently used ones
- better potentiometer needed (just insulated)
- same voltage range as current ones for the controller pins (3-5,5V)
- FUSE
- additional led signaling that we still have power (after fuse)

# Deign Notes:
- DRV882X Lib part
	- Design for JEDEC MO-153
	- Observe Guidelines for TI AN slma00XX.pdf
	- Design for 1.6A Itrip = Vref/(5*Sense) = 3.2v/(5*0.4)
		-Best Practice observe Irms 1.13A @ 0.4Î©=0.512W select 1w for Isense
		- Cost for 2 x 1206 or 4 x 0805 vs 1 x 1W 2512. 
- Layout
	- 50 mils off pins 
	- 80 mils on PVDD_X 
	- 60 mils on OUT_X.
TODO:
- Build calculator to qualify values, requirements.
- Build Eagle library parts. 
	- DRV882X refer to datasheet/drv8824.pdf and ../appnotes/sima00Xb.pdf
	- Silks vs Photo imageable 
		- 5-6 mills for Silks (5 Mills is pushing it)
		- 4Mill lines without an issue (small characters.PI only)   
- Author Schematic
- Design Layout
	- Mouse Bites, v-score (active score) route (might be tough on the 	Vacuums  
- Need to check what happens if we loose main voltage because of fuse breaking
  and still have powered other side (logic one)
- qualify the value/rating of current sense resistor for the DRV8825. //Calculated for 256mW added overhead then selected 0.5W
- design for the package of the DRV8825 current sense resistor.
- order samples of the DRV8824 from TI. 
- new Eagle layout.
- peer review new eagle layout. 
- source heat sink //possibly machine preexisting (12V*1.6A=19.2W)  
- qualify design.  
- test alpha.

Fuse in 0603 package requires soldering to replace, not very easy, small fuses with smd
holders will be quite expensive.
